# Algorithmic Trading Research

My goal here is to develop a rough understanding of financial data and how algorithmic trading works. As of the time of writing this, I am about to start my final semester of my senior year at Pitt.
I am studying Chemistry and Business Analytics and am about to start a career as a Navy Nuke. I love solving problems and I think that finance is more accessible and lucrative than chemistry at this pointin my education and life. A PhD would be awesome, however the idea of waiting another 5 to 8 years after the Navy to start my career does not sound awesome. This brings me to finance. I view the stock 
market as a living, breathing, problem and I want to try my hand at solving it. 

I have no formal training in finance as of right now. I will be taking Intro to Finance this final semester of undergrad so that should be neat. However, I intend to self-study statistical analysis, back testing, and various risk-aware strategies. I'll be start with a small sample of US equities and ETFs using daily frequencies with the goal of gaining intuition, experience, and skills required. 

I have a passion for learning and want to use machine learning to solve hard problems and this is where I am starting (outside of class at least).
